# NO2-Prediction-and-Satellite-Image-Generation
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting ground-level NO2 concentrations and generating satellite images using a multimodal approach. The project leverages advanced deep learning models, specifically CNN+Transformer, and integrates meteorological data with satellite imagery to deliver accurate environmental forecasts.
